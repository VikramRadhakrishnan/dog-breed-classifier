# dog-breed-classifier
A transfer learning based approach to classify images of various dog breeds. This is my project work for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree.

## Setup instructions
The files and datasets for this project are taken from [Udacityâ€™s Dog Classification Project
GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification). Specifically, the dog images dataset was downloaded from this [link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) and the human images dataset was downloaded from this [link](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). To run the notebook, simply download the data into the same directory as the notebook. Follow the setup instructions on the [Udacity Deep Learning with PyTorch GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) to install the required libraries in your workspace to run the notebook. Alternatively, use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), download the dataset to your Colab workspace, and run the notebook there. All required libraries are already installed in Colab.

## Project description
The notebook containing the code can be found [here](./dog_app.ipynb). The notebook contains a lot of descriptive text so should be self explanatory. There is also a project report to summarize the work done, that can be found here.
